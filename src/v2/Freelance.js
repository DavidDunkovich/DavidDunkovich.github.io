      `Shiny Key Realty is a real estate company that operates in Appleton, Wisconsin. They were lacking
      any website at all, meaning the owners had to communicate all information with clients strictly over the phone or email.
      `,
      `
      The website simplifies most of this work. It provides a way for clients to contact them directly on the website. This feature uses Node.js to send a formatted email to the company owner.
      The website allows the owners to manage listings of available homes and their current status at their convenience. 
      This feature uses an admin login page which unlocks a content management system created with React and Firebase.

    description: `In Uganda, and most sub-Sahara African countries, individuals with disabilities
    are viewed as less than human. At Sure Hope Foundation,
    they believe that every child deserves a future, no matter their physical or
    mental capabilities. Sure Hope Foundation helps fund the primary school, Sure Prospects,
    located in Entebbe, Uganda. For every 3 children attending the school without
    disabilities, one child with disabilities can attend school free of charge.`,

    boarding school with little government aid, Sure Prospects is in need of funds for
    supplies, food, handicap accessibility, clean water, salaries, etc. Owner, and starter, of
    Sure Hope Foundation reached out to get a website in place to help spread the word and make donations

    description: `Our team had to respond to the hackathon prompt: 
    "Come up with an idea that would help Liberty Mutual become the best insurance company on
    the planet." Being a recent new hire, we realized how inefficient the onboarding process was and knew
    there was room for improvement.`,
    description2: `After collecting data throughout the company, we concluded that on average current employees
    waste a week's worth of time during this process. Our application is similar
    to a shopping cart in the way that the user can add whichever programs and security groups they need to their cart.
    Once they're finished, all of the programs would begin installing and all of the security group access forms would
    be sent out. Furthermore, a manager could do this work prior, generate a link on the final screen of our app, and share
    the link to their new employees, saving them even more time. If the app were continued to be developed, it could save hundreds
    of thousands of dollars per hiring cycle as well as provide new hires with a better experience.`
