      description: `In Uganda, and most sub-Sahara African countries, individuals with disabilities
      are viewed as less than human. At Sure Hope Foundation,
      they believe that every child deserves a future, no matter their physical or
      mental capabilities. Sure Hope Foundation helps fund the primary school, Sure Prospects,
      located in Entebbe, Uganda. For every 3 children attending the school without
      disabilities, one child with disabilities can attend school free of charge.`,

      boarding school with little government aid, Sure Prospects is in need of funds for
      supplies, food, handicap accessibility, clean water, salaries, etc. Owner, and starter, of
      Sure Hope Foundation reached out to get a website in place to help spread the word and make donations

    "Come up with an idea that would help Liberty Mutual become the best insurance company on
    the planet." Being a recent new hire, we realized how inefficient the onboarding process was and knew
    there was room for improvement.`,
    description2: `After collecting data throughout the company, we concluded that on average current employees
    waste a week's worth of time during this process. Our application is similar
    to a shopping cart in the way that the user can add whichever programs and security groups they need to their cart.
    Once they're finished, all of the programs would begin installing and all of the security group access forms would
    be sent out. Furthermore, a manager could do this work prior, generate a link on the final screen of our app, and share
    the link to their new employees, saving them even more time. In total, the app could save hundreds
    of thousands of dollars per hiring cycle.`

    customer information during house showings. Rather than requiring the customer to physically write it down and for Ryan
    to later input it into an excel document, this web application is used during home showings to
    collect that same customer information from a tablet which is then stored into a database and used
    to send an automated email to the customer. On top of that, there is an admin side to the app in which
    all customer information can be neatly accessed, searched, and sorted. Soon after, Shiny Key reached out to also
    create a website for them.`
